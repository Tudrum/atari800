I've added more advanced gamepad support to emulator ver. 4.2.0

Im not sure if LPT_joy and OSK (on screen keyboard) will work with my changes.
I intent to fix those in the future.
Also there is no support for command line arguments for now and
gamepads cannot be configured from UI.

Best way to configure gamepad support is to edit configuration file (atari800.cfg)

All options for advanced gamepad support starts with "SDL_PAD_", then goes pad number (0-3),
then option.

New pad options added (with default values):

SDL_PAD_0_JOY_DEADZONE=15000   - tells pad what is the size of deadzone (0-32767)

SDL_PAD_0_JOY_TOLERANCE=0.100000 - pad deadzone tolerance, eg. tolerance 0.1 means 10%
                                   so for deadzone 15000 and tolerance 0.1 pad joystick
                                   will start registering joystick deviation of
                                   16500 (15000 + 0.1 * 15000) and stop when at
                                   13500 (15000 - 0.1 * 15000)

SDL_PAD_0_JOY_USE_AS_STICK=1 - enables reading joystick in games

SDL_PAD_0_HAT_USE_AS_STICK=1 - enables reading hat in games (dpad)

SDL_PAD_0_JOY_USE_IN_MENUS=0 - enables joystick in menus

SDL_PAD_0_HAT_USE_IN_MENUS=0 - enables hat in menus

SDL_PAD_0_IN_MENUS_SELECT_BUTTON=0 - button used in menus to select options

SDL_PAD_0_IN_MENUS_BACK_BUTTON=1 - button used in menus to back to previous window
                                   (and exit ui completely)

SDL_PAD_0_AUTOFIRE_FREQ=2 - frequency of autofire, see below


Button options:

eg.
SDL_PAD_0_BUTTON_3_FUNC=FNPAD_FIRE_HOLD     - button nr. 3 for gamepad 0 will trigger
                                              fire when hold

SDL_PAD_0_BUTTON_3_SP_FUNC=FNPAD_AUTOFIRE_TOGGLE  - button nr. 3 for gamepad 0 will trigger
                                                    fire when hold, but when pressed with
                                                    "special" button

SDL_PAD_0_BUTTON_10_FUNC=FNPAD_SP_HOLD      - button nr. 10 for gamepad 0 will act as
                                              "special" button

In this example pressing button 3 will trigger "fire" on emulated joystick.
Pressing button 10 and 3 simultaneusly will toggle autofire.

Configuration supports for 16 buttons.


Autofire:

Autofire frequency - when autofire is on then frequency says how many atari frames have
 fire button pressed and how many don't. Frequency equal to 2 tells that fire will be
 pressed for 2 frames and released for next 2.

Autofire toggle - pressing button for autofire toggle will enable autofire, pressing
 button again will disable it.

Autofire hold - pressing button for "autofire hold" will enable autofire for the time
 hold button is pressed (releasing it will disable autofire). If autofire is enabled
 by "autofire toggle" button then "autofire hold" will reverse autofire behaviour
 (holding "autofire hold" will disable autofire)

Fire toggle and fire hold works similarly to autofire only for continuous fire.


Possible button functions:

FNPAD_NONE - no function
FNPAD_SP_HOLD - "special button"
FNPAD_FIRE_HOLD - "fire hold" button
FNPAD_FIRE_TOGGLE - "fire toggle" button
FNPAD_AUTOFIRE_HOLD - "autofire hold" button
FNPAD_AUTOFIRE_TOGGLE - "autofire toggle" button
FNPAD_START_HOLD - START function button
FNPAD_SELECT_HOLD - SELECT function button
FNPAD_OPTION_HOLD - OPTION function button
FNPAD_TURBO_HOLD - TURBO button (enabled untill button is released)
FNPAD_TURBO_TOGGLE - TURBO button (switches turbo on/off)
FNPAD_EXIT - exit emulator
FNPAD_UI - show menu ui
FNPAD_SAVESTATE - not programmed yet
FNPAD_LOADSTATE - not programmed yet
FNPAD_WARMSTART - warmstart (RESET button)
FNPAD_COLDSTART - coldstart (atari off/on)
FNPAD_BREAK - break key button
FNPAD_SCREENSHOT - take screenshot
FNPAD_SCREENSHOT_INTERLACE - take interlaced screenshot
FNPAD_KEYB - on screen keyboard - untested, probably not working
FNPAD_HELP - HELP button
FNPAD_ESCAPE - escape button
FNPAD_KEY_SPACEBAR - spacebar button

Other atari key can be emulated with FNPAD_CODE_
FNPAD_CODE_[hex code of the key]

for example: FNPAD_CODE_15 will emulate pressing "b" key (helpfull for game "Ghostbusters" where
 "b" key deploys bait)
Key codes in hex are written in "akey.h" file
To simulate shift + key one can add 0x40 to key code, for example FNPAD_CODE_55 goes for "shift+b"
Same goes for ctrl key but with value 0x80 (FNPAD_CODE_95 goes for "ctrl+b")


TODO:
1)Better support for loadstate and savestate, this needs major work to be done in many files
2)Better configuration of gamepads from UI
3)Checking of osk and LPT joystick because their code colide with mine.
  I don't have a lpt port so this will be tricky to test and eventually repair.
